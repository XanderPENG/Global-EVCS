# Overview
This repository contains all codes (written in Python) and (sample) dataset of the paper - 
***Where Are Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Located Globally? Insights from a Spatial Planning Perspective***.

## TODO List
- [x] Codes for the global EVCS distribution analysis
- [x] Codes for the raw EVCS data processing
- [x] Codes for the population coverage analysis
- [x] Codes for the POI analysis
- [x] Codes for the road network analysis
- [ ] Codes for the housing price analysis


# Prerequisites
It is highly recommended to install and use the following versions of python/packages to run the codes:
- ``python``: 3.10.6
- ``numpy``: 1.26.4
- ``pandas``: 2.2.1
- ``matplotlib``: 3.8.0
- ``seaborn``: 0.12.2
- ``shapely``: 2.0.1
- ``geopandas``: 0.14.2
- ``transbigdata``: 0.5.3
- ``networkx``: 3.1
- ``statsmodels``: 0.14.0
- ``cartopy``: 0.23.0
- ``arcpy``: It is highly recommended to install the ArcGIS Pro 2.8 version to run the **arcpy-related codes**. 
 Even though the related-functions could also be implemented by other packages (e.g., geopandas), 
 the arcpy package is more efficient and convenient for the spatial analysis and geometry operations.

# Usage
Clone/download the repository to your local disk.
Unzip the dataset file (``data.zip``) to the same directory as the ``codes``.
