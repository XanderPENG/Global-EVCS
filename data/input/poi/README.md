# Description of the raw POI data
This folder should contain the raw POI data of the 3 study area. 
The raw POI data is collected from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database (For the USA and Europe). 
However, the raw POI data is not directly available in this repository due to the size limitation,
which can be downloaded from the OSM website or requested from the authors.
