# Boundary data
This directory contains boundary data (with the `shp` format) for the 3 study areas (i.e., China, The US, and Europe), 
which can be easily downloaded from related websites (e.g., OpenStreetMap). Meanwhile, the file size is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. 
Thus, we do not provide the boundary data directly.
