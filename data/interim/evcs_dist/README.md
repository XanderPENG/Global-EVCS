# EVCS Distribution data
This folder contains the EVCS Distribution data (`shp` format). It is a variant of EVCS data, where we count the number of EVCS in country/city level.
This could be easily done by aggregating the EVCS data by country/city level shp.
Also, the data is not directly uploaded here due to its large size.
